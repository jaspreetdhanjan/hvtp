# The Hyperverse Transfer Protocol (HVTP)


    The recent convergence of high-speed internet communications and the wide-spread availability of consumer Virtual Reality (VR) hardware has made collaborative VR a possibility. Although there are many social VR experiences, we argue that non allow for fast and easy content sharing. Furthermore, social VR platforms are restricted to their respective app ecosystem. We propose an alternative approach: the Hyperverse Transfer Protocol (HVTP). This is an application-level networking protocol, which aims to allow clients to view and share changes to the Collaborative Virtual Environment (CVE) using a shared scene-graph. This project uses glTF as the common interchangeable scene-graph format to describe the CVE. Moreover, since glTF is a widely-supported format, we investigate the opportunities to create a platform agnostic graphical distributed system. In one example, we investigate sharing graphics between two highly-successful game engines: Unity and Unreal Engine 4. Lastly, we look at optimisation techniques in this novel form of distribution to increase bandwidth and reduce latency for real-time immersion.
