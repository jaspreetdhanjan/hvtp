# The Hyperverse Transfer Protocol (HVTP)

The distribution of 3D information between native heterogeneous applications has been a challenging problem to solve. Today, developers are uncomfortable will the pricey walled-garden ecosystems that are currently present in our devices. Furthermore, there is no real protocol and convention for real-time model sharing between applications. We propose a new approach: the Hyperverse Transfer Protocol (HVTP). This is an application-level networking protocol, which aims to allow clients to view and share changes made to the Collaborative Virtual Environment (CVE) using a shared scene-graph. This project uses glTF as the common interchangeable scene-graph format to describe the CVE. Moreover, since glTF is a widely-supported format, we investigate the opportunities to create a platform-agnostic graphical distributed system. In one example, we investigate the sharing of graphics between a Unity and Python client. Lastly, we look at optimisation techniques in this novel form of distribution to increase bandwidth and reduce latency for real-time immersion.
